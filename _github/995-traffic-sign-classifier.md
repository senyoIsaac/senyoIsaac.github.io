title: "Automated Traffic Sign Recognition Using Deep Learning"
permalink: /github/traffic-sign-classifier
excerpt: "This project focuses on automated traffic sign recognition using a deep learning model trained on the GTSRB dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented in PyTorch and deployed via a Streamlit web app, allowing users to upload and classify multiple traffic sign images at once. The system provides real-time predictions with confidence scores and displays results in a grid format for easy interpretation.<br/><img src='/images/gtsrb.png'>"
