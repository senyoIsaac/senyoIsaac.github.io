title: "Multi-User Sleep Tracker"
permalink: /github/sleep-tracker
excerpt: "I created a multi-user web app that lets each user log in with a unique username and record their sleep sessions. All entries—start and end times, duration, and comments—are automatically saved in the browser’s Local Storage under that username. The app also generates a daily total sleep chart using Chart.js, providing an at-a-glance visualization of sleep patterns. Users can edit or delete existing records and export or import their data as JSON files, making it easy to back up or transfer. This simple, self-contained tool helps maintain ongoing sleep logs without needing a server or database.<br/><img src='/images/sleep.png'>"
