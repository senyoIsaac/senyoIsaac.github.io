title: "Four Rooms Reinforcement Learning Problem"
permalink: /github/four-rooms
excerpt: "The Four-Room Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem is a classic grid-world environment where an agent navigates through four interconnected rooms, separated by narrow doorways. The agent must learn optimal policies to reach a goal state from any starting position, using actions like moving up, down, left, or right. The problem is designed to challenge exploration and learning efficiency, as the agent encounters varying rewards and obstacles, requiring it to balance exploration and exploitation while navigating through a structured, partitioned space.<br/><img src='/images/four_rooms.png'>"
