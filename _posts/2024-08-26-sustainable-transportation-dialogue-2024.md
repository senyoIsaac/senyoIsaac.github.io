In my experience during the summer course in the Netherlands, I was deeply inspired by the country's commitment to sustainable transportation, particularly its cycling culture. The Dutch approach combines innovative infrastructure with a strong emphasis on safety and accessibility, creating an environment where cycling is the norm rather than an exception. This transformative experience instilled in me a renewed sense of responsibility and optimism about reshaping urban transportation in the U.S. to be safer, more sustainable, and inclusive for all users.
