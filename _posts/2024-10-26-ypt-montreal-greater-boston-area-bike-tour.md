I led a group of around 30 transportation engineers, city planners, and other professionals from Jeunes Professionnels en Mobilité / Young Professionals in Transportation Montréal on a bike tour across the Greater Boston Area. Starting in Boston and biking through Cambridge and Somerville, we explored new cycling infrastructure in these cities. We discussed policies like the Cycling Safety Ordinance by the City of Cambridge and the Safe Streets Ordinance by the City of Somerville, which aim to improve safety and accessibility for all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians. The tour highlighted the impressive progress in cycling infrastructure and how much has changed over the past decade.
