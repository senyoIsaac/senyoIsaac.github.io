title: "Modification of Bitumen with Waste Materials for Enhanced Aggregate Retention in Surface-Dressed Roads"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/bitumen-modification
excerpt: 'Raveling, the loss of aggregate from surface dressing, poses significant maintenance challenges and economic burdens for road agencies, especially in developing countries. This study explored the use of locally available waste materials, such as ground-tire rubber (GTR), as sustainable bitumen modifiers to mitigate raveling, finding that GTR-modified bitumen significantly reduces aggregate loss under adverse conditions, making it a viable alternative for improving chip seal performance.'
