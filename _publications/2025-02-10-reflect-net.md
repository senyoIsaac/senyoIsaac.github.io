title: "Sign-Aware Attention-Based Multitasking Framework for Integrated Traffic Sign Detection and Retroreflectivity Estimation"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/reflectnet
excerpt: 'We propose SAAM-ReflectNet, a deep learning framework that automates traffic sign detection, classification, and retroreflectivity estimation by integrating robust spatial-semantic feature extraction, Sign-Aware Attention, and multimodal fusion of RGB and LiDAR data. Achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.635 and RMSEs of 0.169 (foreground) and 0.147 (background), ReflectNet demonstrates scalability and accuracy, making it ideal for large-scale, proactive traffic sign maintenance.'
